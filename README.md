# Virtual Machine (VM) Manager (DevOps Final Thesis Project)

## Project Overview 
This project implements a **Virtual Machine Manager** for the Code.Hedgehog platform, allowing students to work on Linux-based virtual machines without needing a powerful local PC or manual VM configuration. The system provides a REST API for creating, managing, and deleting VMs on demand, and includes a **hot VM pool** to reduce provisioning delays. And in this project is capable of managing virtual machines across multiple hypervisors through **libvirt**, supporting VM lifecycle management, VM pooling, SSH-over-WebSocket terminal access, student usage metrics, Ansible configuration, and Prometheus/Grafana monitoring.

### Key features:

* Create, start, stop, delete, and list VMs via REST API.
* Hot VM pool for instant VM availability.
* Automatic VM configuration using **Ansible**.
* Incremental backup support via a snapshot system.
* Logging of all VM operations.

## ✅ 1. Multi-Hypervisor Support (Hybrid)
The system supports any hypervisor accessible via **libvirt**, including:
- **QEMU/KVM** (tested)
- **Microsoft Hyper‑V**
- **VMware (vSphere, Fusion, Workstation)**
- **Xen**
- **Proxmox VE**
- **Direct KVM**

Hypervisor selection is configured via:
```
config/settings.py → LIBVIRT_URI
```

---

## ✅ 2. VM Lifecycle Management
Implemented full VM control:
- Create VM
- Start VM  
  - Returns error **409** if VM is already running  
- Stop VM  
  - Graceful shutdown → forced shutdown if needed  
  - If the VM is already stopped → 200 OK (no-op)
- Delete VM
- List VMs (libvirt-backed)
- VM state WebSocket stream:  
  `/ws/vm/{name}/status`

---
## ✅ 3. VM Image Pool (Hot Pool for Fast Provisioning)
To reduce wait time (like AWS/GCP do), the system maintains a pool of pre‑warmed VMs:

- Automatically created on backend startup  
- Ensures each pool VM is **shut off and ready**
- Self‑heals if pool VMs are manually removed
- Endpoint:
  - `/pool/status`
  - `/pool/allocate`
  - `/pool/status`
  - `/pool/allocate`
  - `/pool/capacity` (PUT: Dynamically scale the pool size up or down)

This aligns with the thesis argument:

> Cloud creation = slow (~1 minute),  
> hot pool = instant VM delivery.

---

## ✅ 4. SSH Tunnel via WebSocket (xterm.js Compatible)
Implemented full SSH forwarding:
- Browser connects via WebSocket:
  ```
  /ws/vm/{name}/terminal
  ```
- Backend establishes SSH connection to VM
- Input/output proxy to xterm.js
- Terminal session logged in **asciinema v2 format**:
  ```
  logs/ssh/{session_id}.cast
  ```

---

## ✅ 5. Asciinema-Style Logging
Each SSH terminal session is fully logged in asciinema-compatible JSON lines:
- Timestamp
- Input/output marker
- Raw terminal data

Useful for:
- Student behavior analysis
- Playback of sessions
- Debugging labs

---

## ✅ 6. Prometheus + Grafana Monitoring
The system exposes:
- HTTP request metrics
- VM activity metrics
- SSH session metrics
- Resource usage collectors

Endpoint:
```
/metrics
```

Prometheus → Grafana → Dashboard ready.

---

## ✅ 7. Ansible Integration with Sudo Password API
Some hosts need `sudo` during provisioning; others have passwordless sudo.

Implemented:
```
POST /ansible/auth   → stores sudo password in RAM
POST /ansible/clear  → clears it
```

Then, during VM create:
- If password present → passed to Ansible as `ansible_become_pass`
- If not → Ansible runs normally

Ansible Playbook:
```
ansible/playbooks/configure_vm.yml
```

**Dynamic Playbook Management:**
The system now features a full CRUD API for managing Ansible playbooks on the fly. You can upload lab instructions (e.g., `docker-lab.yml`) via the API and pass them as a list when creating a VM. The backend will execute them sequentially.

Endpoints:
- `GET /playbooks`
- `POST /playbooks`
- `PUT /playbooks/{name}`
- `DELETE /playbooks/{name}`

Includes:
- Package install
- UFW configuration
- Lab file deployment

---

## ✅ 8. Dynamic Base Images & Cloud-Init Bootstrap
The system supports multiple OS distributions (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, Arch) dynamically. 
- Pass a `base_image` parameter during VM creation to select the OS.
- The backend automatically uses `cloud-localds` to generate a `cidata.iso` virtual CD-ROM.
- This cloud-init injection securely sets up the default SSH user (`student`) and password on the very first boot, allowing Ansible to connect immediately without manual intervention.

## Running Ansible Configuration

Once a VM is created, it will be automatically configured via Ansible:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.ini ansible/configure_vm.yml -e target_host=<vm_name>
```

This can be customized per project requirements (install software, configure network, etc.).

---

## Notes

* **Hot VM Pool**:

  * Maintains a fixed number of pre-created, shut-off VMs.
  * Reduces provisioning time for new students.

* **Snapshots & Backups**:

  * VM snapshots are automatically created when stopping a VM.
  * Incremental backups save only user-made changes.

* **Error Handling**:

  * All API responses return HTTP status codes properly.
  * Internal errors are logged via `core.logger`.

* **VM creation takes 45–90 seconds due to**:
  * Base image cloning
  * Libvirt boot time
  * Ansible provisioning  
  This matches cloud VM behavior.

* **Hot pool provides **near‑instant VM allocation****.

* **SSH-over-WebSocket design allows secure browser-based terminals (xterm.js)**.

* **Asciinema logging enables reproducibility and analytics**.

* **System works on **any hypervisor** supported by libvirt**:
  * This demonstrates hybrid architecture.

---

## Future Improvements

* Integration with Docker Compose for isolated environments.
* Add more sophisticated monitoring (CPU, memory usage).
* CI/CD pipelines for automatic VM deployment.
* Support for multiple hypervisors and cloud providers (e.g., OpenStack, Yandex Cloud).

---
